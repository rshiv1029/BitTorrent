Generalized Notes on BitTorrent

What is BitTorrent?
BitTorrent is a P2P protocol for distributing files.

P2P:    
    P2P stands for peer to peer which is unlike the normal client-server model. In P2P, every peer/participant 
    has the same capabilities. Peers can upload and download to one another.

Torrent Files are broken up into pieces

Torrent File consists of:
SHA1 Hash (for validation)
Info (Filename)
Announce (Tracker URL)
Piece Length

Swarm: set of nodes/users getting a file
Tracker: Central server in the hybrid P2P model that keeps track of who is in the swarm, tracker is notified when a node joins
Seeder (Original Downloader): nodes in the swarm that have 100% of the torrent file, in the swarm to distribute the torrent file; Seeders only upload because they have nothing to download. 
Leecher (End User): nodes in the swarm that do not have the complete torrent file, in the swarm to obtain the full file, can become a seeder once they have 100% of the file (can choose to stay in swarm or leave)

Peer protocol
4 Total States: choked, unchoked, interested, not interested
Choked: Node is not giving data
Interested: Node is interested if another node has a piece that it does not have

Ex. Node P0 and P1
Data flows from P0 to P1 if and only if:
P0 is interested in P1 and P1 is not choking P0

All nodes are initialized as choking and not interested

Piece Selection Algorithm:

The goal of the algorithm is to replicate all the pieces of the torrent file. 

The first piece to download is chosen randomly to quickly create a piece replica and participate in uploading as a leecher.
After the first piece it chooses the rarest piece among the seeders and leechers that are uploading.
Last piece isn't done by rarest, request is sent to all peers, so fastest peer sends it.
